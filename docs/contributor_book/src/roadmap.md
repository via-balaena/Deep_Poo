# Roadmap

Forward-looking areas to track and improve. Update this as priorities shift.

## Near-term priorities (example placeholders)
- Stabilize Bevy/WGPU bump plan (0.17 → next) and verify capture/inference.
- Harden recorder extensibility: documented sink interface, sample custom sink.
- Tooling UX: simplify warehouse_cmd, improve overlay/prune ergonomics.
- Docs: finish contributor book chapters; keep user book in sync after renames.

## Medium-term (example placeholders)
- Model work: additional detector variants/configs; quantization/export guidance.
- Training: more schedulers/augmentations; benchmark harness.
- Inference: backend selection UX; performance profiling docs.
- CI: optional GPU lane for WGPU smoke; artifact caching for ETL/train tests.

## Longer-term (example placeholders)
- Multi-app stories: clearer templates and scaffolding for new domains.
- Pluggable data sinks (DB/object store) with schema compatibility guarantees.
- Telemetry/observability hooks for runtime.

Keep this list short and actionable; link to issues/PRs when concrete.
