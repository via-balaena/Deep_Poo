# Probe Controls

- **Tension** `[ [ ] ]`: 0.01–5.0× spring rest length (lower = tighter).
- **Stiffness** `[ ; ' ]`: 20–5000 spring stiffness (higher = stiffer).
- **Damping** `[ , . ]`: 0.5–200 spring damping (higher = less oscillation).
- **Thrust** `[ 1 2 ]`: 5–200 forward force on the rear segment.
- **Speed Clamp** `[ 3 4 ]`: 0.05–5.0 target forward speed.
- **Linear Damping** `[ 5 6 ]`: 0.01–2.0 linear drag on segments.
- **Friction** `[ 7 8 ]`: 0.1–3.0 surface friction for the probe.

Values update live and are mirrored in the top-left HUD. Press the keys to tighten/loosen and adjust movement to suit different tunnel sections.
