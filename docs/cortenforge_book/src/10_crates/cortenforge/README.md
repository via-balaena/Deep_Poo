# cortenforge (umbrella)

## Overview
Umbrella re-export crate that wires features across the stack.

## Usage
Depend on `cortenforge` and enable features for the stacks you need; docs.rs: https://docs.rs/cortenforge; source: https://github.com/via-balaena/CortenForge/tree/main.

## Pitfalls
Feature flags fan out across crates; keep defaults light.
