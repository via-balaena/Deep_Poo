# CortenForge Book

This book is a concise, end-to-end guide to the CortenForge workspace: a high-level overview, a practical "Building Apps" guide, a calm crate overview, and optional deep dives. It minimizes redundancy by pushing API detail to docs.rs and source links while keeping the mental model and integration steps here.

How to use this book:
- Start with the Workspace chapter for the architecture map and shared constraints.
- Use Building Apps to assemble a real app stack and trace the core flows.
- Dive into Crate chapters only when you need implementation details.

If you need a quick answer, search for the crate name and jump to its overview page.
