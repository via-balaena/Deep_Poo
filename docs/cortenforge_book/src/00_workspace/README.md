# Workspace

**Why**: The big, calm map of the whole project.
**How it fits**: Gives you the mental model before details.
**Learn more**: If you want a story path, jump to [Building Apps](../20_building_apps/README.md).

This chapter answers, "What is CortenForge, and how do the pieces fit?"

What you will get:
- a simple mental model of the crate landscape
- the main data/runtime flows in one place
- the contracts that keep capture, training, and inference aligned

How to use it:
- skim the overview first
- follow links when you want depth
- if this feels heavy, jump to Building Apps and come back later
