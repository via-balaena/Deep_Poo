# Building Apps

This chapter is a calm, step-by-step story for building a real app with CortenForge. Each page adds one small piece, shows how it fits, and points you to crate pages + docs.rs for deeper detail.

How to read:
- Go in order. Every page is short and predictable.
- Each step ends with an "Unlocked" line so you feel progress.
- If you want detail, follow the links instead of reading long text here.

Story arc (AstroForge Surveyor):
- A scout ship navigates an asteroid field.
- It tags promising rocks.
- It learns from captures.
- It deploys a detector in real time.
- It schedules and monitors runs like mission control.
