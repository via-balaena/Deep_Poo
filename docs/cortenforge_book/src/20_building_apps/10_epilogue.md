# We celebrate and choose the next adventure

**Why**
You now have a full mission stack: capture, train, and inference. This is a real app pipeline, not just a demo.

**How it fits**
- You can stop here and still have something useful.
- When you want depth, follow the links to crate pages and docs.rs.

**Try it**
- Skim one crate page that felt most exciting.

**Learn more**
- Crate index: [Crate Overview](../10_crates/README.md)
- Workspace map: [Workspace Overview](../00_workspace/overview.md)

**Next missions (pick one)**
1) Make it faster: enable WGPU and compare FPS. (See [models](../10_crates/models/README.md), [training](../10_crates/training/README.md), [inference](../10_crates/inference/README.md).)
2) Make it safer: add validation thresholds and better logging. (See [burn_dataset](../10_crates/burn_dataset/README.md), [capture_utils](../10_crates/capture_utils/README.md).)
3) Make it smarter: swap TinyDet → BigDet and track accuracy. (See [models](../10_crates/models/README.md), [training](../10_crates/training/README.md).)
4) Make it operable: add a scheduler + TUI dashboard. (See [cortenforge-tools](../10_crates/cortenforge_tools/README.md), [cli_support](../10_crates/cli_support/README.md).)
5) Make it yours: replace the story world with your domain data. (See [data_contracts](../10_crates/data_contracts/README.md), [vision_core](../10_crates/vision_core/README.md).)

**Note**
- If something feels stubby, check the crate README for a “Known stubs” callout.

**Unlocked**
You are ready to build your own missions.
