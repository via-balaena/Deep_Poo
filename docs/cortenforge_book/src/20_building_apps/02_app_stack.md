# We choose a small stack

**Why**
Starting small keeps learning calm. We only add crates when the story needs them.

**How it fits**
- Start with simulation + vision + capture.
- Add training and inference later.

**Try it**
- `cargo check -p cortenforge-sim-core`

**Learn more**
- Crate index: [Crate Overview](../10_crates/README.md)
- Workspace map: [Workspace Overview](../00_workspace/overview.md)

**Unlocked**
You have a minimal stack to begin the journey.
