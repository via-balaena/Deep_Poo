# Introduction

Welcome to the CortenForge user guide. This book shows how to use the substrate (sim_core, vision_core/runtime, data_contracts, models, training, inference, capture_utils, colon_sim_tools) with `colon_sim` as the worked example.

Build this book:
```bash
mdbook build docs/user_book
```

What you’ll find:
- Happy-path walkthrough (capture → ETL → train → infer) with default commands.
- Minimal usage for capture (sim_view/datagen), ETL, training, inference, and tools.
- FAQ/Troubleshooting for common questions.

Prereqs:
- Rust + Cargo installed.
- GPU optional: defaults work on CPU/Metal/NDArray; WGPU paths are opt-in via features/env.
- Build docs: `mdbook build docs/user_book`
