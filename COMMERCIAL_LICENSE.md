# Commercial License

This project is licensed under Apache-2.0. The implementation is a reduced, simulation/education-focused demonstration inspired by inchworm-style anchoring/extension concepts; it does not replicate proprietary hardware or clinical configurations.

**No patent license is granted under this notice.** Any commercial use that practices patented methods or claims requires a separate license from the patent holder. The commercial license for this repository only covers the project’s source code and original supervisory/control logic.

If your organization wishes to use this software with commercial support or custom licensing terms, commercial licenses are available from Via Balaena for the domain-agnostic automated control logic and the Burn-based reinforcement/vision data collection, training, and implementation system.

Use of any Endotics patents or hardware is outside the scope of this repository and its commercial license. If your intended use would practice Endotics-patented methods or require Endotics hardware, you must obtain permission or licensing directly from Endotics.
